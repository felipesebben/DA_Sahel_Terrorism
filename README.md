# Data Analysis of Terrorism in Sahel Countries.
This project seeks to analyze terrorism activities in Africa with a focus 5 Sahelian countries – Mali, Chad, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and Niger. We aim to understand how this phenomenon has evolved throughout the past decade and how it has spread across many areas as a transnational activity. Given that the region, coupled with Western Africa’s political instability, suffers from a series of challenges which include poverty, climate change-related issues, interethnic rivalry, fiefdom, poor governance, and corruption, understanding the spread of terrorism can reflect a series of negative results elsewhere. Hence, this project will try to answer the following questions:
1.	How has terrorism evolved during the past years?
    -	Has the attacks increased or decreased?
    - What time of year?
2.	Who are the main perpetrators?
    - Which groups?
    - Where do they act?
